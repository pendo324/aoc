### Usage

Create a .env file and add your AOC_SESSION_COOKIE.

`npm i` then `npm run create-day [year] <day>` to download a day. Re-run to download the second part of the question as markdown after you've unlocked it.

Use `npm run <year>-<day>` to run the relevant `index.js` file for that day.

#### Note
On windows, for some unknown reason, `npm i` will fail if you aren't logged in. Use `npm login` before running `npm i`.
